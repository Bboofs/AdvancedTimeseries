# Timeseries for Everyone

### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/advanced-timeseries by Data For Science.

### Run the code in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DataForScience/AdvancedTimeseries/master)

Large scale availability of time varying data originating in financial, economical and social systems has led to a rise in the interest in this class of algorithms. Understanding how to model and describe time series information is a fundamental skill in any data scientists toolkit.

In this lecture, we will introduce you to the libraries that Python provides for working with time series data. Weâ€™ll quickly review the ARIMA class of models before diving in detail into the more advance ARCH class of forecasting models. Both real and synthetic datasets will be used to illustrate the different kinds of models and their underlying assumptions.
